# WhatsApp Insurance Bot

This project implements a full-stack WhatsApp chatbot using **WhatsApp Cloud API**, **Node.js**, and **PDFKit** to automate insurance plan selection and PDF generation for customers.

Users can interact with the bot by typing `"insurance"` on WhatsApp, choose a plan from a list, and receive a dynamically generated **PDF insurance document** that includes their details and selected plan information.

- ✅ SQLite database to store available plans and user selections.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Webhook Setup**  
   Webhook is registered with WhatsApp Cloud API and handles incoming messages (`/webhook` endpoint).

2. **Triggering the Flow**  
   User sends the keyword `insurance` on WhatsApp. This:
   - Sends a pre-approved template with a static insurance PDF.
   - Asks the user to select a plan by replying with a number (1–5).

3. **PDF Generation & Delivery**  
   When the user responds:
   - The selected plan is fetched from the database.
   - A **custom PDF** is generated using PDFKit with:
     - Plan name, description, coverage
     - User’s WhatsApp number
     - Current date
   - The PDF is uploaded to WhatsApp and sent as a document.

4. **Database**  
   Two tables:
   - `insurance`: stores 5 pre-defined insurance plans
   - `user_selection`: logs user's chosen plan and phone number
